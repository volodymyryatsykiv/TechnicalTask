Also you have to add FloatingActionButton like on image above and two items to Toolbar. You don't need to handle click on FloatingActionButton and on items in Toolbar.


You can generate list of users in your code but it would be much better to implement request from application to download users from this [link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/volodymyryatsykiv/TechnicalTask/master/users.json). 


Additional task: save users to database.
